## Structure

The root of this repository contains the core library, and this library is not setup to be a workspace.  
This repository also contains the `example-counter/` project, where the library compilation will _not_ trigger the example compilation. To best visualize and edit the example, you should open it independently from the root of this repository (eg. `code example-counter/` to open it independently and in a new editor in vscode).
